# Quantum Field Theory

Matt Strassler has a great [blog](http://profmattstrassler.com/). Three (very basic) blog posts on the topic of particles and fields are:

* [Fields](http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/fields/)
* [Particles Are Quanta](http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/7-particles-are-quanta/)
* [How Particles and Fields Interact (an introduction)](http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/8-how-particles-and-fields-interact/)

He also has a nice series of blog posts about the Higgs mechanism:

* [How the Higgs Field Works (with math)](http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/)

Some of the textbooks on QFT that I have used are:

* *Introduction to Quantum Field Theory* by G. Sterman: Well-balanced, but dated. Some calculations in QCD.
* *Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell* by A. Zee: Very informal, but a broad overview of the topic.
* *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory* by M.E. Peskin and D.V. Schroeder: One of the classics, a bit dated.
* *Quantum Field Theory* by L.H. Ryder: Short but sweet.
* *Quantum Field Theory* by M. Srednicki: An instant classic, many modern topics like spinor-helicity methods.
* [*Fields* by W. Siegel](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~siegel/errata.html): This book has a little bit of everything. Very dense, but very rewarding. Many exercises. A **must-read** for anyone who wants to be a high-energy theoretical physicist in the 21st century.

Note that Srednicki's book is available for **free** through his [website](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html). Other books on related topics in quantum field theory include:

* *Path Integrals in Quantum Mechanics* by J. Zinn-Justin: Only path integrals.
* *Functional Integration* by P. Cartier and C. DeWitt-Morette: If you really want to learn some functional analysis.
* *Quantization of Gauge Systems* by M. Henneaux and C. Teitelboim: Further details on BRST, fermions and antifields.
* *Aspects of Symmetry* by S. Coleman: A collection of lectures on diverse topics. Somewhat dated.
* *The Analytic S-Matrix* by R.J. Eden, P.V. Landshoff, D.I. Olive and J.C. Polkinghorne: Scattering.
* *An Introduction to Regge Theory and High Energy Physics* by P.D.B. Collins: Scattering and Regge Theory.

In the coming years a book by P. van Nieuwenhuizen will appear on advanced topics. I am sure it will be great.

# Yang-Mills Theory and the Standard Model

Any good book on QFT should discuss Yang-Mills theory and the Standard Model. Here are some physics references, most of which I have never used, since they are very recent:

* *Classical Solutions in Quantum Field Theory: Solitons and Instantons in High Energy Physics* by E.J. Weinberg.
* *Introduction to Elementary Particles* by D. Griffiths.
* *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* by M.D. Schwartz.
* *The Standard Model and Beyond* by P. Langacker.
* *Gauge Theories of the Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetic Interactions* by C. Quigg.
* *Modern Particle Physics* by M. Thomson.

Some of these books might require revisions in the coming years. Physicist are still playing with the bubble wrap that came with the newly-discovered Higgs-like particle at the LHC. We live in exciting times!

Pure gauge theory can also be studied in a very mathematical way. Some references are:

* *The Geometry of Physics* by T. Frankel.
* *Geometry, Topology and Physics* by M. Nakahara.

I myself have forgotten what a fiber bundle is...

# Twistors and Conformal Symmetry

Conformal symmetry is relevant to many areas in physics. Some general references are:

* [Conformal Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3472)
* *Conformal Field Theory* by P. Di Francesco, P. Mathieu and D. Sénéchal.

Twistor methods are useful to describe the kinematics of massless particles. They are used to calculate scattering amplitudes in more efficient ways. The so-called amplituhedron program, and the earlier grassmannian program, use twistor variables. Some general references are:

* [Calculating Scattering Amplitudes Efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9601359)
* [Multi-Parton Amplitudes in Gauge Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509223)

A good way to start with this topic is to learn a bit about the twistor string program:

* [Lectures on Twistor Strings and Perturbative Yang-Mills Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0504194)
* [Perturbative Gauge Theory As A String Theory In Twistor Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0312171)
* [On the Tree-Level S-Matrix of Yang-Mills Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0403190)

Twistors were originally developed by Penrose. Like pure gauge theory, one can study twistors in a very mathematical way. Some references are:

* [Twistor theory: An approach to the quantisation of fields and space-time](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0370-1573(73)90008-2)
* *Twistor Geometry and Field Theory* by R.S. Ward and R.O. Wells Jr.
* *Spinors and Space-Time* by R. Penrose and W. Rindler.

# Supersymmetry and Supergravity

There are two kinds of references on supersymmetry (SUSY) and supergravity (SUGRA): formal and applied. Some applied references are:

* *Supersymmetry and String Theory: Beyond the Standard Model* by M. Dine.
* *Supersymmetry in Particle Physics: An Elementary Introduction* by I. Aitchison.

Some formal references, in the form of textbooks, are:

* *Introduction to Supersymmetry and Supergravity* by P. West.
* *Modern Supersymmetry: Dynamics and Duality* by J. Terning.
* *Supersymmetry and Supergravity* by J. Bagger and J. Wess.
* *Supergravity* by D.Z. Freedman and A. Van Proeyen.
* [*Superspace, or One thousand and one lessons in supersymmetry* by S.J. Gates Jr, M.T. Grisaru, M. Rocek and W. Siegel.](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0108200)

Other formal references, in the form of lecture notes from the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org), are:

* [Lectures on Supersymmetry Breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0702069)
* [Introduction to Supersymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0101055)
* [Introduction to Supersymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9612114)
* [Introduction to S-Duality in N = 2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theory. (A pedagogical review of the work of Seiberg and Witten)](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9701069)
* [Duality in Quantum Field Theory (and String Theory)](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9709180)
* [Lectures on supersymmetric gauge theories and electric-magnetic duality](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9509066)
* [Introduction to supergravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3502)
* [Introduction to Supergravities in Diverse Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9802138)

Duality is a very important topic in current efforts to understand non-perturbative degrees of freedom of gauge theories.

# String Theory and AdS/CFT

For a brave attempt at relating string theory to the real world, see

* *String Theory and Particle Physics: An Introduction to String Phenomenology* by L.E. Ibáñez and A.M. Uranga.

References on string theory include:

* *A First Course in String Theory* by B. Zwiebach.
* *String Theory* by J. Polchinski: Both volumes are **mandatory** for any aspiring string theorist.
* *String Theory and M-Theory: A Modern Introduction* by K. Becker, M. Becker and J.H. Schwarz: More recent than Polchinski, more geometry-oriented.
* *Superstring Theory* by M.B. Green, J.H. Schwarz and E. Witten: Classic and still somewhat relevant.
* [Lectures on String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0333)
